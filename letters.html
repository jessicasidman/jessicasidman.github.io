<hr>
      Please write to me at least three weeks in advance of the first
    deadline to ask if I can write a letter for you. If I agree to
      write, please send me
<ul>
      <li>an unofficial transcript</li>
      <li>a resume</li>
      <li>(optional) a draft of a cover letter or personal statement
      if you think it will help me write a better letter</li>
      <li>a link to a shared google spreadsheet (to which you have
      given me edit privileges) containing
      <ul>
          <li>a list of each program you
      are applying to
          <li> mode of submission (an email address or a note
      stating that I'll receive a submission link)</li>
          <li> the due date</li>
	  <li> a column where I can check off the ones that I have
      submitted</li>
      </li>
      </ul>
 </ul>
 Please try to send links to me either all at once or in large batches
 so I am not chasing down many links over several months.  I'll upload
 letters once a week, so please get links to me at least a week in
 advance of your deadline.  Links that come in a day or two before a
 deadline may result in a late letter submission.  <br><br>

 If I have not checked off a letter as submitted a week before it is
    due, please send me an email reminder.  If you add to your
    spreadsheet after I have submitted all of the letters originally
    requested, please send me an email as I don't get a note when you
    edit the spreadsheet and won't know there are more to do.<br><br>

 Finally, let me know how it goes and what you decide to do!<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
